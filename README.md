Nesting: The traveler details are all related to the traveler, so we put them in an object called "Traveler". The "email" and "phone" strings are both related to contacting the traveler, so we made them values associated with the key "contact". Arrays: For "destinations" and "activities", we used an array of objects. We chose an array because the objects have a similar structure and the order could potentially be important. The "activity" objects themselves define keys of "title" and "time". Scalability: To store hotel information, we'd want to use an object containing all info related to that hotel. If there are multiple hotels, we could store the hotel objects within an array. This same method would work for transportation options. Real-World Application: This manner of organization is useful in a travel app or API because it can be exported into a dynamic webpage to serve a client. Not only will it be easy to pull from such organized data, but we can make it dynamic by utilizing forms to add additional data such as new hotels and new locations.
